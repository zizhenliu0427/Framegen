# Framegen

**Silky-smooth video in your browser.** A Chrome extension that turns 24-30 fps
video into 60-240 fps in real time - with a neural network running entirely on
your GPU. No servers, no accounts, nothing leaves your computer.

## About this fork

Personal fork of [MONZikWasTaken/Framegen](https://github.com/MONZikWasTaken/Framegen)
with fixes I needed on macOS and bilibili. Everything else is upstream.

- **ProMotion / slightly-slow panels**: a 120Hz panel measured at ~118-119Hz keeps
  its nominal 120Hz capacity, so 60fps video still gets 2x ([#16](https://github.com/MONZikWasTaken/Framegen/issues/16))
- **Dark Reader**: player UI lives in a closed shadow root so page restylers can't recolor it ([#17](https://github.com/MONZikWasTaken/Framegen/issues/17))
- **Full refresh** toggle: Match display at 100% of the panel rate instead of 97% (off by default) ([#18](https://github.com/MONZikWasTaken/Framegen/issues/18))
- **4K canvas** toggle: lifts the 1920x1080 canvas cap up to the source resolution (off by default) ([#12](https://github.com/MONZikWasTaken/Framegen/issues/12))
- **HDR full-screen fix** (macOS only, on by default): keeps SDR→HDR correct when the video fills the screen ([#19](https://github.com/MONZikWasTaken/Framegen/issues/19))
- **Auto-enable** per-site allowlist ([#2](https://github.com/MONZikWasTaken/Framegen/issues/2)): FG turns on by itself for a large, playing video on sites you opted in.
  Hover previews / mini windows and YouTube ads are skipped unless *Auto: small players* / *Auto: during ads* are on; picture-in-picture never qualifies.
  A manual off sticks for the current page.
- **HDR video** option for native HDR sources (PQ/HLG) on an HDR display ([#15](https://github.com/MONZikWasTaken/Framegen/issues/15)).
  Chrome only hands extensions a grey, SDR-tonemapped frame, which looks overexposed next to the native HDR video.
  - *Show original* (default): leave native HDR video alone
  - *Gentle HDR* / *Real HDR* (experimental): measure Chrome's curve with a bundled PQ/HLG ramp, then map back to nits.
    Colors won't fully match the original, and dense bright detail can flicker while interpolating.

Install: `chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → Load unpacked → select the `extension` folder.

## What it does

- **2×-6× more frames** on any `<video>` - movies, series, sports, anime,
  screen recordings; YouTube and most video sites
- **Auto mode** picks the highest factor your GPU actually sustains, and backs
  off before you'd see a stutter
- **Anime mode** detects animation drawn "on twos" and interpolates the real
  motion instead of the duplicated frames
- **Display-Hz mode** follows your monitor with a small recovery margin so an
  occasional delayed frame does not turn into a permanent drop
- **Compare slider** - drag a divider across the video: original on the left,
  Framegen on the right
- **Private by construction** - the whole pipeline runs on your GPU; we collect
  literally nothing

An interpolated frame costs ~2 ms on a mid-range GPU (RTX 4060 Ti) - the
model and inference runtime are custom-built for this (a 2.9 MB network on
hand-written WebGPU kernels; details in [docs/TECHNICAL.md](docs/TECHNICAL.md)).

## Install

**[Add to Chrome from the Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/framegen-frame-interpolat/hpdpcjakhclhljfdkpjolonjlopbdhfk)** - one click.

Manual install (if you want the newest build before it clears store review):
download `framegen-extension.zip` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/MONZikWasTaken/Framegen/releases/latest),
extract it, open `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**, click
**Load unpacked** and select the extracted folder.

Requirements: **Chrome 121+** on a machine with a GPU (Windows, macOS with
Apple Silicon, Linux). Firefox and Safari don't ship the WebGPU features we
need yet.

### Development install

The repository keeps the WebGPU runtime and released model files in
`extension/`, so a fresh clone is directly loadable on macOS, Windows, and
Linux. `tools/build_extension.ps1` validates those files and creates both
release ZIP layouts; it fails instead of packaging a missing, mismatched, or
stale runtime payload. If local model exports exist in the ignored `assets/`
directory, their hashes must match the tracked payload. Use
`tools/build_extension.ps1 -PromoteLocalAssets` to deliberately promote those
exports, then review and commit the resulting `extension/assets` changes.

For ordinary non-DRM HTML5 players, the overlay mirrors CSS `object-fit`
(`fill`, `contain`, `cover`, `none`, and `scale-down`) and `object-position`.
If an unscaled source exceeds the FHD canvas safety limit, Framegen leaves the
raw video visible instead of presenting a misaligned overlay.

To load a development checkout locally:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`.
3. Enable **Developer mode**, choose **Load unpacked**, and select the
   repository's `extension` folder.
4. Reload the video page after reloading the extension.

The Debug setting in Framegen's gear menu shows source-frame timing,
`requestVideoFrameCallback`, render-loop, inference, presentation, and canvas
dimensions for troubleshooting.

## How to use

1. Open any video and hover over it - a round **FC** button appears at the
   left edge of the player.
2. Click it. The button turns green, an fps readout appears, and the video is
   now interpolated. Click again to turn it off.
3. The **gear** button next to it keeps the quick settings inside the player.
   Choose **Advanced settings** there or in the extension popup when you want the
   full-screen profile editor.

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Output rate** | `auto` is right for most people and can use an optional FPS limit. You can also choose any custom Target FPS, fixed 2×-6×, or `display Hz` to pace just below your monitor's measured limit for recovery headroom. A custom target is kept between 2× the measured source FPS and the real display/GPU limit |
| **Quality** | Resolution of the inserted frames. `480` is the sweet spot; raise it on a strong GPU |
| **Model** | `v7s` (current default) or `v6` (legacy; retained until v8 replaces it) |
| **Anime mode** | Keep on for anime; harmless elsewhere |
| **SR 2×** | Neural upscale of inserted frames - costs GPU, sharper result |
| **Compare** | The split slider, for seeing the difference yourself |

The full settings page lets you keep the live settings as-is or save any number
of your own local profiles that can be created, duplicated, renamed, deleted,
and reset. It also exposes
the supported visibility controls, including the FPS counter, small
`framegen` watermark, and optional performance notices. Existing settings
are migrated without losing values.

**Good first test:** anything shot at 24 fps - a movie trailer, a film scene
with a slow camera pan, an anime opening. That's where the difference hits
hardest. On a 60 Hz screen you'll see 24→60; on a 144-240 Hz screen,
considerably more.

## FAQ

**It says "no video found" / the button doesn't appear.**
Make sure the video is actually playing. On some players the button appears
only when the mouse is over the video itself.

**Does it work on Netflix / Crunchyroll?**
No, and it can't: DRM-protected video is invisible to extensions by design -
the browser hands us black frames. YouTube and most other sites work.

**My fps counter shows less than the promised factor.**
Auto mode adapts to your GPU's real headroom - it will never stutter to hit a
number. Lower the quality setting or the factor ceiling if you want more.

**Does it phone home?**
No. There is no server, no telemetry, no analytics. The extension is a local
GPU pipeline; the code is right here to check.

**Is my GPU good enough?**
If it can run the video at all, 2× at 480p almost certainly fits. The HUD
shows the per-frame cost in ms - budget is roughly `(factor-1) × cost <
frame interval`.

## The story

Framegen is older than this repo. The idea - and the first prototype - date
back six months before the first commit here. That prototype never got
published: it worked far too poorly to show anyone. But the idea refused to
go away, and for half a year I kept watching the space - and nobody shipped
it properly: real-time neural frame interpolation, in the browser, on any
video, for anyone. So I decided to build it myself. That's how Framegen
happened.

## Support the project

Framegen is built by **one person** with one mid-range GPU. The extension is
free and will stay free - but the models behind it are not free to make:
every training experiment runs on rented cloud GPUs paid out of pocket
($5-30 per run, and a new model generation takes dozens of runs before one
is good enough to ship). The next, bigger model is designed and waiting -
mostly for GPU-hours.

sooner:

Starring the repo helps too - visibility is the other currency.

## Use it as a library

The inference runtime is on npm as [`framegen`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/framegen)
(MIT) - real-time neural frame interpolation for your own project in ~20
lines, weights included:

```js
import { createRT } from 'framegen';

const BASE = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/framegen@1.4.7/weights';
const rt = await createRT(device, {
  w: 1280, h: 720, textureInput: true, textureOutput: true,
  weightsBin: await fetch(`${BASE}/rt_v7s.bin`).then(r => r.arrayBuffer()),
  weightsManifest: await fetch(`${BASE}/rt_v7s.json`).then(r => r.json()),
});
rt.prepPair(frameA, frameB); // t-free trunk, once per pair
rt.runT(0.5, outTexture);    // any t in (0,1), ~1-2 ms each
```

Full API and notes: [packages/rt](packages/rt). Working example: [framegen-fps-booster](https://github.com/MONZikWasTaken/framegen-fps-booster) ([live](https://monzikwastaken.github.io/framegen-fps-booster/)).

## Under the hood (the short version)

A distilled RIFE-family student (2.9 MB) runs on a hand-written WGSL runtime -
raw WebGPU compute shaders, no ML framework, matching the PyTorch reference to
1 LSB. The pipeline is fully GPU-resident: frames never cross to the CPU. From
the first naive browser attempt to today is a **×500-980 speedup**
(1957 ms → 2.0-3.75 ms per frame, 720p-1080p).

## License

Code: **MIT** ([LICENSE](LICENSE)) - the extension and the inference runtime
([`framegen`](packages/rt) on npm), embed it in anything, commercial included.
Model weights: non-commercial research/personal use
([WEIGHTS_LICENSE.md](WEIGHTS_LICENSE.md)) - they are distilled from a
RIFE-family teacher whose license chain isn't clean enough to free them yet.
